Bonjour! During my exciting exchange semester at EMLV - École de Management Léonard de Vinci, I delved into the dynamic world of Cultural and Creative Industries. Imagine studying Merchandising & Cultural Retail, Talent Management, Production Management, Event Management, Transmedia Storytelling, and even Video Gaming & E-Sports Management – it was a whirlwind of creativity and learning! From exploring iconic landmarks like the Louvre and TF1 during our field trips to experiencing the bustling ambiance of Printemps Haussmann department store, every moment enriched my understanding of cultural and creative industries

One of the absolute highlights was teaming up with my fellow students to organize an exhibition titled "De l'ombre à la lumière" (From Shadow to Light). From brainstorming the perfect theme to scouting out the coolest venue, rallying for funds, setting up dazzling installations, and ensuring everyone had a blast with our entertainment – we were in full creative mode!

Beyond the classroom and our exhibition prowess, I also honed my French skills and explored the enchanting Loire Valley, soaking in the charm of its majestic castles. France's spirited culture and the joie de vivre of its people made my adventure truly memorable, leaving me eager to "revoir" Paris soon!
